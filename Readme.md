## Introdution
LC3_sim is a clock-driven behavior simulator of LC3 CPU. It assumes that all instructions can be done in one cycle. Detailed microarchitecture and ISA description can be found on **<< Introduction to Computing System >>** by Yale Patt. 

The codes are mainly writen by my TA *Chivier Humber*. I finish the rest but still not verify them all.



ps: Assembler is not verified

ps: "to be done" means this is not a verified code and may have some logic problems
