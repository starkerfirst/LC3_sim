#### Introdution
LC3_sim is a clock-driven behavior simulator of LC3 CPU. Detailed microarchitecture and ISA description can be found on ** << Introduction to Computing System >> ** by Yale Patt. 

The codes are mainly writen by my TA * Chivier Humber *. I finish the rest but still not verify them all.

ps: Assembler is not verified
ps: "to be done" means this is not a verified code and may have some logic problems
